# Amplify Shader Editor Community Extras
## WHAT
A bunch of additional things for [Amplify Shader Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570). 
* HANDY new shader functions
* more SNAZZY example graphs
* COOL extra nodes

Tested in Unity 2019.1.0f2 and ASE v1.6.7. Make sure you already have ASE installed in your project otherwise you will probably get materials with missing textures!

## WHY
Having extra examples and resources scattered among the different discord channels and the forums makes it hard to find what you're looking for sometimes, so having it all in one nice (searchable) place seems handy.

## WHO
Anyone is welcome to add their resources to this repo.  All creators are credited in the readme file associated with their contribution. Right now it's just lazily curated by me (DMeville)


# Table of Contents
This should probably be turned into a wiki at some point.
